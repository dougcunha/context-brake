# Create SDD PRD

1. Extract the problem, outcome, and feature name from the request. Resolve `tasks/prd-[slug]/prd.md`; a new slug is `[NN]-[name]`, where `[NN]` is the next two-digit number after the existing folders, in implementation order, and `[name]` is kebab-case. If the PRD exists, reuse it without overwriting. Update only when authorized; preserve unchanged IDs. When `tasks/prd-[slug]/context-snapshot.md` exists, apply the load protocol in `.agents/skills/sdd-orchestrate-tasks/references/session-continuity.md` before reading sources.
   **Output:** unambiguous destination and operation; request only missing information that prevents identifying them.
2. Inventory users, journeys, metrics, FR, NFR, constraints, dependencies, accessibility, and out-of-scope items. Consult local evidence, including `docs/research/`, before researching public rules or integrations in primary sources; send read-only explorers only when the local evidence spans many files. Record origin and distinguish fact, assumption, and product decision; ask only about gaps that change scope or acceptance.
   **Output:** every obligation has evidence or an explicit assumption; blocking decisions are identified.
3. When drafting, read [assets/prd.template.md](assets/prd.template.md) in full. Use stable IDs `OBJ-01`, `US-01`, `FR-01`, and `NFR-01`, each with observable acceptance. Keep architecture and sequencing in the TechSpec. Record supplied stack and platform constraints.
   **Output:** all applicable sections filled; unique IDs; no requirement without acceptance.
4. Write only the PRD and report path, pending items, and obligations added, changed, or removed. Point out derived artifacts to revalidate without editing them. In the orchestrated flow, return the artifact for product HIL; previous authorization applies to the scope it covers. In standalone use, run the session pause from that reference with `sdd-create-techspec` as next step.
   **Output:** reviewable PRD on disk; source divergences and conflicting IDs resolved or explicitly pending.

Read each source once per version; use links for extensive evidence. On updates, preserve unchanged sections to reduce diff and context.
