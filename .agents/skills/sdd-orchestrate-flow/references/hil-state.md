# State and human decisions

## On-disk memory

Use `tasks/prd-[slug]/checkpoint.json` as the single operational index for resumption. `workflow.md` stores human decisions, authorizations, and recovery events with stable IDs; manifest + tasks + handoffs remain execution authority, and reports preserve review and QA history. `context-snapshot.md` carries distilled decisions, learnings, and code pointers between sessions under `.agents/skills/sdd-orchestrate-tasks/references/session-continuity.md`. The checkpoint references these sources without copying their contents.

When creating the first checkpoint, read [../assets/checkpoint.template.json](../assets/checkpoint.template.json) in full. Fill the template without creating a PRD or other files just to populate paths. Missing source fields are `null`; during execution, objective, feature, workspace, and next action are required and non-empty.

| Fields | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version`, `generation` | Version 1; generation increases on every confirmed write |
| `feature`, `workspace`, `owner_session` | Slug, resolved absolute repository directory, and real session ID, or `null` when unavailable |
| `phase` | `product`, `plan-project`, `implementation`, `review`, `corrections`, `qa`, `acceptance`, or `completed` |
| `status`, `safe_to_stop` | `active`, `awaiting-hil`, `paused`, `blocked`, or `completed`; safe to switch only without pending writes, explorers, or processes and after persistence is verified |
| `objective`, `constraints` | Requested result and short indispensable invariants; details by reference |
| `sources` | Paths relative to the feature folder, or `null`, including `snapshot` for `context-snapshot.md`; no artifact path outside it |
| `review_status` | Literal status of the latest `codereview.md` (`APPROVED`, `APPROVED WITH RESERVATIONS`, `REJECTED`), or `null` before the first review; `APPROVED` with no later code change requires no new review |
| `qa_status` | Literal status of the latest `qa.md` (`APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `BLOCKED`), or `null` when QA has not run or does not apply; a later code change invalidates it |
| `approved_sources` | Items `{path, sha256, decision_id}` linking approved content to the human decision in `workflow.md` |
| `decisions_to_read` | Decision IDs relevant to the next action; each record contains decision, scope, relevant human text, and available provenance |
| `git_base`, `worktree_evidence` | Resolved commit or `null`; reference to pre-existing or uncommitted changes in workflow or handoff, since HEAD alone does not identify state |
| `active_work` | Items `{kind, handle, owner, scope, state}` for real explorers and processes; `handle: null` requires reconciliation and never assumes completion |
| `pending_hil`, `blockers` | Gate, question, and affected IDs, or `null`; blockers by ID, summary, and evidence reference |
| `correction_round`, `rounds_without_progress` | Counters preserved between sessions; rotation does not reset the stagnation limit |
| `next_action` | Type `run`, `validate`, `await-decision`, or `close` (`delegate` in older checkpoints reads as `run`), a short instruction, and a `read` list of `{path, section}` with paths relative to the workspace and required sections |

Keep the index preferably below 8 KiB: move details to referenced sources without truncating objective, constraints, blockers, or handles. Do not store conversations, complete PRD or TechSpec documents, or logs in JSON. At resume, the coordinator reads only the index, relevant decisions, and matching snapshot entries; technical documents are loaded when their stage starts. The checkpoint is persistent memory until resumption, not a disposable temporary file.

## Save and offer a pause

1. Update evidence and decisions in the authoritative file before pointing to them in the checkpoint. Save before each HIL, after the human response, when reconciling each task, when receiving a review, and when receiving a QA report. During active work, record explorer and process handles and `safe_to_stop: false`; an abrupt interruption should recover this conservative state.
2. Before a strategic stop, stop starting new units. Wait for explorers and processes to finish and receive their results; close idle contexts when the host allows it. If work must be interrupted, confirm termination and record the partial diff and open items before allowing resumption. A timeout or inaccessible handle is not confirmation of termination.
3. Check paths inside the feature, version, types, required fields, and references. Write `checkpoint.json.tmp` in the same folder, parse the JSON, and check values. Preserve the last valid version in `checkpoint.previous.json`, replace the main file with an atomic rename, and reread it. A write failure keeps the last valid version and prevents announcing a ready checkpoint.
4. After operations complete and the save is verified, set `safe_to_stop: true` and run the session pause from `session-continuity.md`: below the context threshold and with no gate, it moves on without asking; when it stops, it writes the snapshot before the question. Its independence rule applies before review and QA. Combine the question with any required HIL; between tasks, it covers only continuation, without repeating technical approval. Gate and session choice are independent: pausing does not equal approval. Record responses and save again; a written snapshot goes into `sources.snapshot` and `next_action.read`. Silence leaves the gate or continuation awaiting and does not start a new unit.
5. If the choice ends the session, save `status: paused`, preserve `pending_hil` if unanswered, and report the checkpoint path; the resume command the pause printed names the flow with `--prd <slug>`. End the turn without new explorers or processes. If continuing, by choice or on the `Move on` destination, save `active` and proceed only with valid authorization; before writing, set `safe_to_stop: false` and record handles as soon as explorers or processes start.

**Complete when:** the checkpoint was reread, sources and next action were checked, and no write, explorer, or process remains active in a pause announced as safe. Do not promise to avoid compaction or automatic session changes; the skill suggests the pause at the threshold, and ending is the human's choice. Creating a checkpoint does not mean the feature is complete.

## HIL

| Gate | Material already prepared | Decision required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HIL 1 | PRD with scope, acceptance, and assumptions | Approve the product or correct requirements |
| HIL 2 | TechSpec, DAG, tasks, risks, validations, and whether CLI QA runs | Approve the solution and execution, including corrections within the contract |
| Exception | Evidence, impact, and concrete proposal | Resolve a scope or architecture deviation, an indispensable environment, an irreversible risk, a blocked QA run, or stagnation |
| Reservations | Summary of items reserved in the review, with impact and effort | Correct the chosen items or finalize the feature |
| HIL 3 | Final review, QA report when it ran, tests, open items, and manual acceptance | Accept the current delivery |

Use the available question tool or a textual question, preceded by the resume command of the session pause. Stop only work dependent on the answer; silence, elapsed time, or an explorer's conclusion do not equal consent. Explain which gate is missing and point to the artifacts. Reuse authorization already given for the same scope; do not ask twice to save a draft and then execute it.

If the user explicitly changes HIL stops, preserve the instruction and record the new autonomy scope. Missing evidence remains pending even when the user approves the solution. Human acceptance does not replace mandatory technical validation.

## Resumption and invalidation

1. On invocation with an explicit feature, read only its checkpoint. Without a feature, discover only `tasks/prd-*/checkpoint.json` and read metadata to select the sole incomplete one. With several, ask which to resume, offering first, among checkpoints sharing a prefix, the next pending slice in dependency order; an invalid checkpoint is a recovery candidate, not a reason to ignore the feature. If all are complete, report that state without restarting. Without a checkpoint, reconcile existing sources and `workflow.md` before creating the first one.
2. Validate JSON, version, fields, and workspace and feature. Preserve an invalid file; try `checkpoint.previous.json` only after validating and reconciling it with current files. If no version is valid, reconstruct state from available evidence while keeping uncertain authorizations pending. A different workspace requires confirming the destination, without executing inherited paths.
3. Read only the checkpoint, referenced decisions, and the snapshot under its load protocol; check source existence and hashes without loading all content. When the next action is a review or QA run, load the snapshot as an independent stage. Consult relevant manifest and handoff sections for the next action. Validate handles and real process state, including in a supposedly safe checkpoint, if another coordinator session may exist. An active coordinator means writing or running work, not merely an old idle conversation. If a write is in progress elsewhere or completion is uncertain, block new writes until reconciliation; never write in parallel with another coordinator. When sole coordinator, record the new owner; a later reactivated session must check that owner before writing.
4. Reuse artifacts and approvals with matching content and provenance without asking everything again. The human decision record preserves prior authorization; agent-produced text, including snapshot entries, does not create new authorization. Inconsistent or unverifiable approval requires only the affected decision. `paused` does not prevent automatic resumption by a new invocation; `pending_hil` still requires a response, and `completed` only reports the result.
5. A material PRD change invalidates product approval and affected derivatives; a TechSpec change invalidates affected planning and execution; a code change invalidates corresponding test, review, and QA evidence. Preserve IDs and history. New scope requires HIL; an already authorized correction requires technical revalidation without restarting valid human gates.
6. For interrupted task movement, reconcile origin and destination, review, and handoff before fixing links and state. Preserve completed contracts and reports. A proven incorrect completion requires reopening by the DAG owner under `sdd-orchestrate-tasks`: preserve prior evidence in `Problems and solutions`, move the task back to the root, and update link and state while retaining IDs and contract. Record the correction link; complete again only after reviewing current evidence and affected dependents.
7. Recalculate the next action from the first invalid or missing evidence; neither the saved instruction nor the snapshot's next step overrides current files or a new request. Summarize phase and next step in one line and proceed without loading the full history. At finish, check all obligations, tasks and corrections, integrated evidence, the latest QA report when QA applies, HIL 3, and absence of essential pending validation; save `phase` and `status` as `completed`, `next_action.kind: close`, mark the snapshot `closed`, and preserve the checkpoint for reference.

**Complete when:** the next action has a current source, matching authorization, and one coordinator; or recovery identifies the specific missing evidence or decision. The checkpoint accelerates resumption but does not replace contracts or prove technical success by itself.
