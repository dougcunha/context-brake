# Session continuity

SDD skills write artifacts and code in the session that runs them; subagents are read-only explorers. Work therefore accumulates in one context, and this protocol lets the user end a session at safe points without losing what it learned. It has two parts: the session pause, and the context snapshot the pause may write.

## Session pause

Ask at the points the calling skill names (between tasks, between slices or workstreams, at HIL gates, and before review or QA), only after writes are persisted and no explorer or process is running. Use the host's question tool (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code), or a textual question when none exists. State in one line what just finished, the next step, and, when a ContextBrake telemetry block or harness usage is visible, the current zone. Put the recommended option first and mark it `(Recommended)`:

| Option | When to recommend | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Continue in this session | Green zone and the next step shares most of the loaded context | Proceed |
| Snapshot and continue | Green or yellow zone, but this session produced decisions or learnings worth protecting from compaction | Write the snapshot, then proceed |
| Snapshot and end session | Yellow or red zone, a long unit just finished, the next step needs a different part of the codebase, or the independence rule below applies | Write the snapshot, print the resume instruction, end the turn |
| End session without snapshot | Nothing learned beyond what artifacts, handoffs, and manifests already record | Print the resume instruction and end the turn |

- **Independence.** When the next step is `sdd-review-code` or `sdd-execute-qa` and this session wrote or changed code that step will judge, recommend **Snapshot and end session** regardless of zone and say why: the review needs a session that did not author the code. If the user continues anyway, record the limitation where the caller keeps decisions (`workflow.md` under `sdd-orchestrate-flow`) and in the report's limitations section.
- **Gates.** At a HIL gate, ask the gate question and the session question together. Ending the session does not approve the gate, and approving does not choose the session.
- **Resume instruction.** `Use the <skill> skill to continue <feature or unit> in this repository.`, naming the skill that owns the next step; under `sdd-orchestrate-flow`, it is always the flow. When ending, start no work, explorer, or process after the answer. Silence starts nothing.

## Context snapshot

The snapshot carries what one session learned into the next, limited to what the next step needs. It is a routing table for context: a few inline facts that exist nowhere else, plus pointers that say when to load each durable source. It never replaces the PRD, TechSpec, manifest, task files, handoffs, reports, or code; when they disagree, they win and the snapshot entry is dropped.

### Location

- Skills scoped to one feature: `tasks/prd-[slug]/context-snapshot.md`. Every stage of that feature (planning, tasks, corrections, review, QA) rewrites the same file.
- Skills that span several features (`sdd-orchestrate-prds`, `sdd-plan-audit`): the folder of the next feature to work on, creating the folder with only the snapshot when it does not exist yet. The previous snapshot of the same run gets `status: superseded` and `superseded_by`, so only one stays `active`.

### What belongs

| Include | Leave out |
| --- | --- |
| Decisions taken in the session that no durable file records yet, with a pointer to where they should live | Anything the PRD, TechSpec, task contract, report, or handoff already states |
| Learnings: codebase conventions, environment quirks, commands that fail and why, approaches tried and discarded | Conversation transcript, reasoning narrative, or praise |
| Explorer conclusions still useful for the next step, as `path:symbol` or `path:line` at a known Git head | File contents, code blocks, diffs, logs, or test output |
| Open threads: pending items, reservation hits, blocks, and questions awaiting the user | Secrets, credentials, or user data |

Prefer promoting a durable decision to its real home (the artifact being written, the task handoff, `Problems and solutions` in the manifest, or `workflow.md` under the flow) and keep only a one-line gist plus pointer here. Keep the file under 8 KiB; when it grows past that, prune before adding.

### Structure

The template in [../assets/context-snapshot.template.md](../assets/context-snapshot.template.md) has four parts, in reading order:

1. **Header**: `status` (`active`, `superseded`, or `closed`), `generated`, `stage` (`planning`, `tasks`, `corrections`, `review`, `qa`, or `acceptance`), `stage_source` (the manifest, report folder, or map the stage works from), `covers_through` (last completed unit of that stage: task ID, artifact, or report), `authored_code` (`yes` when the writing session changed code, which the independence rule needs), `git_head`, `worktree`, `next_step` (skill and unit), and `other_eligible`.
2. **Load map**: the tiers below, so the reader knows when each entry applies before reading entries.
3. **Next step brief**: the `now` tier, written for `next_step`.
4. **Entries**: one line each, in sections `Decisions`, `Learnings`, `Code map`, and `Open threads`, with this shape:

   `- [ID] (when: tier: trigger; trigger) gist — src: path#section; until: condition`

   - `ID`: `D-NN` decision, `L-NN` learning, `M-NN` code map, `O-NN` open thread. Keep IDs stable across regenerations so other entries and handoffs can cite them.
   - `when`: the load tier plus its triggers. Triggers are task or finding IDs (`T04`, `CR-03`), path globs (`src/infrastructure/runtime/**`), traceability IDs (`DEC-04`, `RF17`), stages (`review`), commands (`npm run coverage`), or events (`on failure: EPERM`).
   - `src`: where the full detail lives, loaded only when the gist is not enough. `—` when the gist is the only record.
   - `until`: when the entry expires (`T06 done`, `DEC-18 replaced`, `next session`). Expired entries are dropped on the next write.

One line per entry keeps selective loading cheap: `Grep` on `when:.*T04` or on a path fragment finds the entries for a unit without reading the rest.

### Load tiers

| Tier | Load when | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `now` | At session start, before choosing work | Header, next step brief, open threads waiting on the user |
| `on-select` | After choosing the unit, if a trigger matches its ID, affected files, or traceability IDs | A decision that constrains the ledger API for T04 |
| `on-edit` | Just before editing or creating a path that matches | A Windows append quirk for `src/infrastructure/runtime/**` |
| `on-run` | Just before running a matching command, or right after it fails | Test lane registration needed before `npm test` sees a new suite |
| `on-demand` | Only when a gist is insufficient; this applies to every `src:` pointer | The previous review's finding text |

An entry without a matching trigger is not loaded for this unit. The reader decides per tier, not once: new triggers fire as the work reaches new paths, commands, or failures.

### Load protocol

1. Locate the snapshot as the calling skill says. Read the header and load map. If the file is under 8 KiB, read it whole in one call; otherwise read up to the end of the next step brief and use `Grep` for entries.
2. Validate the header:
   - `covers_through` against the stage source (manifest `State`, report folder `done/`, or map). If the source shows more progress, the snapshot is behind: keep entries, but treat the next step brief as stale and reselect.
   - `git_head` against `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `worktree` against `git status --porcelain`. When files changed since the snapshot, entries whose triggers or `src` match those paths are suspect: verify them before relying on them.
   - `superseded` means follow `superseded_by`. `closed` means the stage it describes is finished; report and do not resume from it.
   - An unparseable header makes the whole file a list of hints: re-derive state from the stage source and verify any entry before use.
3. **Independent stages.** A session running `sdd-review-code` or `sdd-execute-qa` loads only the header, next step brief, `Open threads`, and `on-run` entries (environment and command facts). It skips `Decisions`, `Code map`, and other `Learnings`, which carry the author's framing, and derives what it judges from the sources. If this session itself authored the code under review, stop and apply the independence rule of the session pause.
4. Load the `now` tier. For open threads waiting on the user, ask before starting work those threads block.
5. After choosing the unit, load the `on-select` entries that match. Keep the `on-edit` and `on-run` triggers in mind and load those entries when the work reaches them.
6. Follow a `src:` pointer only when the gist leaves a question the work needs answered, reading only the cited section.

### Write protocol

Write only when the unit is recorded (artifact written, task moved, manifest or map consistent) and no explorer or process is running.

1. Start from the previous snapshot, if any. For each entry, drop it if it expired, was superseded, contradicts current sources, or was promoted to a durable file that the next step will read anyway. Keep IDs of surviving entries.
2. Add what this session produced: decisions, learnings, explorer conclusions still valid at the current head, and open threads. Write each gist so it is actionable without the conversation: state the fact and its consequence, not the story.
3. Assign each entry the narrowest tier and triggers that still catch every case where it matters. `now` is for what the next session must know before choosing; most entries belong to `on-select`, `on-edit`, or `on-run`.
4. Rewrite the next step brief: why it is next, the skill and unit, the minimal sources to read first, known change points, and the entry IDs that apply. When several units are eligible, name the recommended one and list the others.
5. Fill the header from current values: `git_head` is `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, `worktree` is `clean` or a short count with the changed top-level paths, `authored_code` is `yes` if this session changed code since the last review, otherwise carry the previous value until a review or QA report covers it.
6. Replace the whole file, then reread it to check the header and that every `src:` path exists. Report the path and size in the pause message.

**Complete when:** the next session can pick the next unit, knows which entries apply to it and when, and has no entry that depends on this conversation to be understood.
