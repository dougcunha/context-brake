# TXX — [outcome-oriented title]

## Outcome

[Observable behavior corrected when the task is complete.]

## Dependencies and boundaries

- Depends on: [IDs or —]
- Unblocks: [IDs or —]
- In scope: [changes in this correction]
- Out of scope: [relevant boundaries]

## Traceability

| Source | Section | Finding covered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| codereview_[num]/CR-01 or qa_[num]/BUG-01 | `[report].md#[section]` | [nonconformity or failure] |

## Requirements

- [Behavior expected by the report, PRD, or TechSpec]
- [Rule and error or edge condition]

## Context to recover on demand

- TechSpec: `[section, if applicable]`
- Rules and skills: [names]
- Code: `[file or symbol]` — [relevance]

## Work

- [ ] TXX.1 [small, verifiable change]
- [ ] TXX.2 [small, verifiable change]

## Acceptance criteria

- [Observable and measurable condition]
- [Nonconformity or failure removed without regression]

## Verification

- Unit: [scenario and result, if applicable]
- Integration: [boundary, fixtures, and result, if applicable]
- End-to-end: [QA scenario rerun against its fixture repository | not applicable]
- Manual: [script, expected result, and owner, if required]
- Platforms: [platforms that must pass]
- Environment dependency: [none | prerequisite, existing authorization, or open item]
- Commands: `[command from AGENTS.md]`
- Expected evidence: [output, test, metric, or artifact]

## Affected files

- Modify: `[path]`
- Create: `[path, if needed]`

## Observability and recovery

- Operational signal: [log or diagnostic output, if applicable]
- Recovery: [rollback or reversal, if applicable]

## Handoff

> Updated by `sdd-execute-corrections` during implementation.

- Produced result: Pending execution.
- Changed files: Pending execution.
- Checks: Pending execution.
- Validated state: Pending execution (code or diff, configuration, platform, and environment).
